# AMG8833-TFT2.8-D1mini

This project is a low cost thermal camera inspired by Ruiz Brothers (https://learn.adafruit.com/thermal-camera-with-display/overview). The differences between my project and his are 
1) the touch capability added to change the temperture range that the heat map display.
2) the highest, lowest, average and the temperture differential of two peak temp will print in the screen.
3) use a 2.8 TFT screen with touch capability.
4) use esp8266 based developtment board (D1 Mini).
5) designed my own enclosure, the STL files can be found in 3D_Modeling folder.

This code reveived huge help from Adafruit. The code can be found in the AMG8833-TFT2.8-D1mini folder.

The simple video demo can be found in this Youtube link.(no link so far)

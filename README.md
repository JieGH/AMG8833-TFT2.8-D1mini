# AMG8833-TFT2.8-D1mini

This project is a low cost thermal camera inspired by Ruiz Brothers (https://learn.adafruit.com/thermal-camera-with-display/overview). The different between my project and his are 
1) the touch capability added to change the temperture range that the heat map display, 
2) the highest, lowest, average and the temperture differential of two peak temp will print in the screen.
3) use a 2.8 TFT screen with touch capability
4) use esp8266 based developtment board (D1 Mini).
5) designed my own enclosure

This code reveived huge help from Adafruit.

The simple video demo can be fond in this Youtube link.

The schematic and PCB are shown in here:
